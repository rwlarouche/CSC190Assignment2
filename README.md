# Backgound Information:

This assignment implements a 2 page website (php):
1. report.php - Users can report their name and where they saw Dr. Evil, along with an automatically generated timestamp. Reports are added to a database.
2. list.php - Users can view a list (much like a Twitter feed) of all reports. All reports include the name of the reporter, where they saw Dr. Evil, and the report's timestamp.

All reports are stored in a MySQL database.
